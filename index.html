    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I'm a surfer turned soldier turned Front End developer-in-training. My career so far has been in analytics and linguistics, but I'm excited about tackling this new challenge I've set out for myself. </p>
    <p>I am fascinated by technology and I can't wait until I'm off and running, and--hopefully--contributing to an ever-evolving, always exciting industry.</p>
    <p>It's important that I live a life that is geared more toward helping others more than myself.</p>

    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I grew up in Portsmouth, Virginia, but I've also lived in Florida, California, Texas, and Abu Dhabi. Now I'm back in my home state just outside of D.C.</p>

    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
    <p>I love learning! I'm a full-time MBA student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I'm also a huge D.C. sports fan and a self-proclaimed food snob and travel junkie. In my "free" time, I'm learning how to be a dad to my brand new baby boy Liam (He has a very particular set of skills)! </p>
    <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
    <p>I like to think of myself as an ideas guy. I'd love to be able to spend my days making great ideas a reality. </p>
    <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
    <p>Lately I've been sticking with some of my favorite punk bands from the 00's: A lot of <a href="http://www.baysidebayside.com/">Bayside</a> and <a href="http://www.alkalinetrio.com/">Alkaline Trio.</a></p>
